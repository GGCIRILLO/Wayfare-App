# Wayfare-App 🏃‍♂️
Stay fit and discover. The final result of the Federico II Apple Foundation Program. 

I attended the Federico II Apple Foundation Program in February-March 2022 at the Apple Developer Academy. 
The Foundation Program is a short-term, challenge-based class designed to provide aspiring world-class developers the opportunity to experience Apple's learning framework while designing iOS app prototypes. 
# App concept 💭
Me and my team (THE APPENGERS) were inspired by the travel and sports big ideas and we ended up realizing this application.
Our idea was an App that provides a way for travelers to merge training and the discovery of local places by interacting with a map and sharing their photos and advices related to a promoted activity. 
# Design 🎨
So we tried to sketch something about the design and then made it real using Figma.

# Coding 📲
Finally, make it a real app. It was not easy but we succeded and me and the Appengers are really proud of their product. 
We used the SwiftUI and MapKit frameworks as interesting technologies. 
First of all, there is an Onboarding page where you can select your favorites activities clicking on their card and once you've completed this step you will be in the main screen. That is an interactive map where map annotations shows you some places around where you can practice your favourite sports.
Tapping on it it will appear the preview card with some information and the you can go further thanks to the "See more" button and look at more details about the selected place. Or either you can slide up the bottom sheet and enter in the Discovery section. Here there is a list with places around that you can filter by sports or simply search typing their name. At this point you can navigate to find more detail about each place seeing the main activity and others with the number of people that are currently doing it. You can join them selecting the activity in that place. 
Last but not least, the profile section. Here there are preferences, favorites places, account detail and your selected activities.

I'm sorry if the code is not optimized or there are some feature missing (example: Login/Logout), but at the end this is not going to be available on the App Store (at least for now 😉), so we put more effort in producing the main features.
Hope you like it, support me! 🧡🧡🧡
