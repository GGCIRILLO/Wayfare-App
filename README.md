# Wayfare-App üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Find your Way(fare). The final result of the Federico II Apple Foundation Program. 

I attended the Federico II Apple Foundation Program in February-March 2023 at the Apple Developer Academy. 
The Foundation Program is a short-term, challenge-based class designed to provide aspiring world-class developers the opportunity to experience Apple's learning framework while designing iOS app prototypes. 
# App concept üí≠
This app was conceived, designed and coded by me and my team, the Appengers ( @gcrbr¬†is on GitHub).
When we travel usually we lose some aspects of our daily routine, for example the diet, personal hobbies as reading, our social connections and sports activity. But have you ever felt the need of keeping one of your habits when away? Sports activity habits in particulare are not easy to maintain, so this was our key idea: create something that gave you the chance to keep this aspect of your routine. 
Wayfare is the solution. 
An app that provides a way for travellers to merge training and the discovery of local places by interacting with a map. The name comes from an ancient word, "wayfarer", which indicates a person who travels on foot, merged with an italian word, "fare", which in english translate into "to do". 
With our app you can explore new places and maintein your sports habits, maybe with local people or other travellers either. 
In three words: Find your Way.
# Design üé®
So we tried to sketch something about the design and then made it real using Figma.

# Coding üì≤
Finally, make it a real app. It was not easy but we succeded and me and the Appengers are really proud of their product. 
We used the SwiftUI and MapKit frameworks as interesting technologies. 
First of all, there is an Onboarding page where you can select your favorites activities clicking on their card and once you've completed this step you will be in the main screen. That is an interactive map where map annotations shows you some places around you where you can practice your favourite sports.
Tapping on it it will appear the preview card with some information and the you can go further thanks to the "See more" button and look at more details about the selected place. Or either you can slide up the bottom sheet and enter in the Discovery section. Here there is a list with places around that you can filter combining sports you like or simply search typing their name. At this point you can navigate to find more detail about each place seeing the main activity and others with the number of people that are currently doing it. You can join them selecting the activity in that place. 
Last but not least, the profile section. Here there are account preferences, favorites places, account detail and your selected activities.

I'm sorry if the code is not optimized or there are some feature missing (example: Login/Logout), but at the end this is not going to be available on the App Store (at least for now üòâ), so we put more effort in producing the main features.
Hope you like it, support me! üß°üß°üß°
